# structures-engineering
This repository serves as a personal portfolio to showcase my work as a structures engineer 

Greetings viewer!
Thanks for taking the time to view my profile. Here you will find all the work I've done so far as a structural/chassis engineer.
It is always being updated. 

You will find most of the relevent content in the form of keynotes. I decided to use keynotes as a way to quickly put together my work in a conscise manner. If you want to find more details, you may refer to the attached documents (eg. reports)

To get started, I would recommend starting off by viewing the presentation titled, "Structures engineering in Team Manipal Racing".
